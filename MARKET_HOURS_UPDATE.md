## Testing

Run the test script to verify the configuration:
```bash
python3 test_market_hours.py
```

## Starting the Market Hours Manager

To start the market hours manager with the new configuration:

```bash
# Regular market hours manager (with all components)
python3 market_hours_manager.py

# Or simple version (Django server only)
python3 market_hours_manager_simple.py
```

## Environment Variables (Optional)

You can still override the market hours via environment variables if needed:
```bash
export MARKET_OPEN="09:30"   # Default: 9:30 AM ET
export MARKET_CLOSE="16:00"  # Default: 4:00 PM ET
```

## Benefits

1. **Resource Efficiency**: System resources are conserved outside regular trading hours
2. **Data Relevance**: Updates occur only when markets are actively trading
3. **Cost Savings**: Reduced API calls and proxy usage during non-trading hours
4. **Focused Operation**: System operates only when meaningful market data is available

## Notes

- The system will automatically start at 9:30 AM ET on weekdays
- The system will automatically stop at 4:00 PM ET on weekdays
- No manual intervention required for weekend shutdowns
- All timestamps are in US/Eastern timezone (automatically handles DST)
