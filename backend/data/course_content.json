When you buy a stock (also called a share or equity), you become a partial owner of that company.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Ownership\nEach share represents a small piece of the company. If a company has 1 million shares and you own 1,000 shares, you own 0.1% of the company.\n\n### Why Companies Issue Stock\nCompanies sell stock to raise money (capital) for growth, expansion, or operations. Instead of taking loans, they sell ownership stakes to investors.\n\n### How You Make Money\n\nThere are two main ways to profit from stocks:\n\n1. **Price Appreciation**: Buy low, sell high. If you buy a stock at $50 and it rises to $75, you've made $25 per share.\n\n2. **Dividends**: Some companies share profits with shareholders through quarterly dividend payments.\n\n## Stock Exchanges\n\nStocks are bought and sold on exchanges like:\n- **NYSE** (New York Stock Exchange)\n- **NASDAQ**\n- **Other global exchanges**\n\nThese exchanges provide a regulated marketplace where buyers and sellers meet.",

          "content": "# Order Types Explained\n\nWhen buying or selling stocks, you need to specify what type of order you want to place. Understanding order types is crucial for controlling your trades.\n\n## Market Orders\n\nA **market order** executes immediately at the current market price.\n\n### Advantages\n- Guaranteed execution\n- Fast - fills instantly\n- Simple to use\n\n### Disadvantages\n- Price may vary from what you see on screen\n- Slippage in volatile markets\n- May get unfavorable price during gaps\n\n**When to use**: When you need to enter or exit quickly and price is less important than execution.\n\n## Limit Orders\n\nA **limit order** only executes at your specified price or better.\n\n### Buy Limit Order\nSets the maximum price you're willing to pay.\n\nExample: Stock is at $100. You set a buy limit at $95. Your order only fills if the price drops to $95 or lower.\n\n### Sell Limit Order\nSets the minimum price you're willing to accept.\n\nExample: You own stock at $100. You set a sell limit at $110. Your order only fills if the price rises to $110 or higher.\n\n### Advantages\n- Price control\n- No slippage\n- Can set and forget\n\n### Disadvantages\n- May never execute\n- Can miss moves if price doesn't reach your limit\n\n## Stop Orders\n\nA **stop order** becomes a market order when a trigger price is reached.\n\n### Stop-Loss Order\nUsed to limit losses. Triggers a sell when price drops to your stop level.\n\nExample: You buy stock at $100. You set a stop-loss at $90. If price drops to $90, a market sell order triggers.\n\n### Stop-Limit Order\nCombines stop and limit orders. When stop price hits, it becomes a limit order (not market).\n\n## Time in Force\n\n- **Day Order**: Expires at market close if not filled\n- **Good Till Canceled (GTC)**: Stays active until filled or manually canceled (usually up to 90 days)\n- **Immediate or Cancel (IOC)**: Fill immediately or cancel\n- **Fill or Kill (FOK)**: Fill entire order immediately or cancel",

          "content": "# Understanding Volume\n\nVolume is one of the most important indicators in trading. It shows the level of interest and activity in a stock.\n\n## What is Volume?\n\n**Volume** = Total number of shares traded during a specific period (usually one day or one bar on a chart).\n\nExample: If volume is 2 million, it means 2 million shares changed hands between buyers and sellers.\n\n## Why Volume Matters\n\n### 1. Confirms Price Moves\n\n**High volume + price increase** = Strong buying interest (bullish confirmation)\n**High volume + price decrease** = Strong selling pressure (bearish confirmation)\n**Low volume + price move** = Weak move, likely to reverse\n\n### 2. Indicates Liquidity\n\n**High volume stocks**:\n- Easy to buy/sell\n- Narrow bid-ask spreads\n- Less slippage\n\n**Low volume stocks**:\n- Harder to enter/exit\n- Wider bid-ask spreads\n- More slippage risk\n\n### 3. Shows Market Sentiment\n\nSudden volume spikes often precede significant price moves:\n- Earnings announcements\n- News events\n- Analyst upgrades/downgrades\n- Sector rotation\n\n## Volume Patterns to Watch\n\n### Volume Climax\nExtreme volume spike, often marking exhaustion:\n- **Buying climax**: Heavy volume at top = potential reversal down\n- **Selling climax**: Heavy volume at bottom = potential reversal up\n\n### Decreasing Volume\nVolume declining during a trend:\n- **In uptrend**: May signal weakening momentum\n- **In downtrend**: May signal selling exhaustion\n\n### Increasing Volume\nVolume expanding with trend:\n- **In uptrend**: Confirms strength\n- **In downtrend**: Confirms weakness\n\n## Relative Volume\n\n**Relative Volume (RVOL)** = Current volume ÷ Average volume\n\n- **RVOL > 2.0**: Very high activity (2x normal)\n- **RVOL 1.0 - 2.0**: Above average\n- **RVOL < 1.0**: Below average\n\n## Volume by Time of Day\n\n**Morning (9:30-11:00 AM)**: Highest volume\n**Mid-day (11:00 AM-2:00 PM)**: Lowest volume\n**Afternoon (2:00-4:00 PM)**: Increasing volume\n\n## Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)\n\nA volume-weighted average of all trades during the day.\n\nInstitutional traders use VWAP to:\n- Measure execution quality\n- Determine fair value\n- Time large orders\n\n**Above VWAP** = Buyers in control\n**Below VWAP** = Sellers in control\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n❌ **Ignoring volume**: Trading based on price alone\n❌ **Trading low volume stocks**: Higher risk, less liquidity\n❌ **Not comparing to average**: Is today's volume unusual?\n\n✅ **Watch for volume confirmation**: Validate price moves with volume\n✅ **Trade liquid stocks**: Minimum 500K-1M daily volume for day trading\n✅ **Use RVOL**: Identify unusual activity",

Buy stock at $50\n2. Price increases to $75\n3. Sell stock\n4. Profit = $25 per share\n\n### When to Go Long\n\n- Bullish outlook on company\n- Uptrend forming\n- Positive news or earnings\n- Technical breakout\n\n### Advantages\n\n✅ Unlimited upside potential\n✅ Receive dividends (if any)\n✅ Can hold indefinitely\n✅ Lower risk than short selling\n\n### Risks\n\n⚠️ Stock can drop to $0 (100% loss)\n⚠️ Capital tied up\n⚠️ Opportunity cost\n\n## Short Positions (Going Short)\n\n**Definition**: Selling borrowed shares with the expectation that price will decrease, then buying them back cheaper.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. Borrow 100 shares at $50 (total value $5,000)\n2. Sell borrowed shares for $5,000\n3. Price drops to $30\n4. Buy back 100 shares for $3,000\n5. Return shares to lender\n6. Profit = $2,000\n\n### When to Short\n\n- Bearish outlook\n- Downtrend forming\n- Negative news\n- Technical breakdown\n- Overvalued stock\n\n### Advantages\n\n✅ Profit from declining prices\n✅ Hedge long positions\n✅ More tools in your toolbox\n\n### Risks\n\n🚨 **UNLIMITED RISK**: Stock can rise infinitely\n🚨 **Margin requirements**: Need margin account\n🚨 **Short squeeze**: Forced buying if price rises\n🚨 **Borrow costs**: Pay interest to borrow shares\n🚨 **Dividend payments**: Must pay dividends to lender\n\n## Key Differences\n\n| Aspect | Long Position | Short Position |\n|--------|---------------|----------------|\n| Direction | Profit from rise | Profit from fall |\n| Max Profit | Unlimited | Limited to stock hitting $0 |\n| Max Loss | Stock goes to $0 (100%) | Unlimited |\n| Time Limit | None | Pay borrow fees |\n| Dividends | Receive them | Pay them |\n| Account Type | Cash or margin | Margin required |\n\n## Short Squeezes\n\nA **short squeeze** occurs when:\n\n1. Stock with high short interest starts rising\n2. Short sellers panic and buy to cover\n3. Buying pressure pushes price higher\n4. More shorts forced to cover\n5. Vicious cycle creates explosive upward move\n\n**Famous examples**: GameStop (GME), AMC Entertainment\n\n### Warning Signs\n- High short interest (>20% of float)\n- Decreasing available shares to borrow\n- Sudden price spike on high volume\n\n## Margin Requirements\n\nTo short sell, you need a **margin account**:\n\n- **Initial margin**: Typically 150% of short position value\n- **Maintenance margin**: Must maintain 125-150%\n- **Margin call**: If equity falls below maintenance, must add funds or close position\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### For Long Positions\n- Use stop-losses\n- Don't chase rallies\n- Buy quality companies\n- Be patient\n\n### For Short Positions\n- Use tight stop-losses (critical!)\n- Don't short strong uptrends\n- Watch for short squeeze signals\n- Cover quickly if wrong\n- Start small - higher risk\n\n## Psychology\n\n**Going long**: \"I hope this goes up!\"\n**Going short**: \"I hope this goes down!\"\n\nMost traders are more comfortable going long because:\n- Market has long-term upward bias\n- Unlimited upside vs limited downside\n- Feels more \"natural\"\n\nShort selling requires:\n- Different mindset\n- Faster reactions\n- Higher risk tolerance\n- More experience",
