## System Alert Levels

### Normal (Green)
- **CPU**: < 60%
- **Memory**: < 70%
- **Disk**: < 80%
- **API Requests**: < 1,000/minute
- **User Impact**: All users have full access

- **Disk**: 80-89%
- **API Requests**: 1,000-1,999/minute
- **User Impact**: 
  - Free users: 60% chance of throttling (3-minute delay)
  - Basic users: 30% chance of throttling (1.5-minute delay)
  - Pro users: 10% chance of throttling (30-second delay)
- Enterprise users: No throttling

### Critical (Orange)
- **CPU**: 80-94%
- **Memory**: 85-94%
- **Disk**: 90-97%
- **API Requests**: 2,000-2,999/minute
- **User Impact**:
  - Free users: 100% blocked (10-minute delay)
  - Basic users: 80% blocked (5-minute delay)
  - Pro users: 40% blocked (2-minute delay)
- Enterprise users: 10% blocked (1-minute delay)

### Emergency (Red)
- **CPU**: ≥ 95%
- **Memory**: ≥ 95%
- **Disk**: ≥ 98%
- **API Requests**: ≥ 3,000/minute
- **User Impact**:
  - Free users: 100% blocked (30-minute delay)
  - Basic users: 100% blocked (15-minute delay)
  - Pro users: 100% blocked (10-minute delay)
- Enterprise users: Full access with possible minor delays

## Progressive Blocking Logic

### Resource-Based Scaling
The system continuously monitors:
1. **CPU Usage** - Server processing load
2. **Memory Usage** - RAM consumption
3. **Disk Usage** - Storage space utilization
4. **Active Connections** - Database connections
5. **API Requests per Minute** - Real-time traffic

### User Prioritization
When resources become constrained, the system prioritizes users based on:

1. **Membership Level** - Higher paying customers get priority
2. **Payment History** - Consistent paying customers get preference
3. **Usage Patterns** - Reasonable usage gets priority over abuse
4. **Geographic Location** - Optional regional prioritization

### Blocking Messages
Users receive clear, actionable messages when blocked:

#### Free Users (Warning Level)
> "System is busy. Free users may experience delays. Upgrade to Basic ($15/month) for better performance."

#### Basic Users (Critical Level)
> "High system load: Basic users may be temporarily restricted. Upgrade to Pro ($30/month) for better access during peak times."

#### Pro Users (Emergency Level)
> "System emergency: Even Pro users are temporarily restricted due to extreme load. Enterprise subscribers ($100/month) have priority access during emergencies."

## Emergency Mode Features

### Automatic Activation
Emergency mode activates when any threshold is exceeded:
- CPU ≥ 95%
- Memory ≥ 95%
- Disk ≥ 98%
- API requests ≥ 3,000/minute

### Multi-Channel Alerts
When emergency mode activates, administrators receive:
1. **Email alerts** with detailed system stats
2. **Slack notifications** (if configured)
3. **Discord alerts** (if configured)
4. **WordPress error log entries**
5. **Database emergency flags**

### Enterprise-Only Access
During emergencies:
- Only Enterprise subscribers can access the system
- All API endpoints check membership before processing
- Clear upgrade messages shown to blocked users
- Automatic retry suggestions with timeframes

## Revenue Optimization

### Upgrade Incentives
The system strategically encourages upgrades by:
1. **Showing exact pricing** in blocking messages
2. **Highlighting benefits** of higher tiers during restrictions
3. **Providing immediate upgrade links** in error responses
4. **Demonstrating value** through differential access

### Fair Usage Policy
- Prevents abuse while maintaining service quality
- Ensures paying customers receive premium treatment
- Creates clear value proposition for each tier
- Maintains system stability under load
