# Backend-Frontend Integration Contracts

Note: This is the same content as contracts.md from your React-1.3 branch. It is served from /contracts.md in the public directory so the Docs page can render it directly without authentication.

- Base: {REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL}
- Prefixes: /api, /api/revenue

Notes:
- This app uses HashRouter for static hosting. URLs will look like /#/path.
- Environment variables (REACT_APP_*) are embedded at build time.

(See repository contracts.md for full content.)
