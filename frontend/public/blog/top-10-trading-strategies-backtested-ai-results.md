# Top 10 Trading Strategies Backtested (AI Results)

Backtesting doesn’t “prove” a strategy will work in the future — it helps you **eliminate fragile ideas** before you risk real money.

Below are 10 popular strategies you can backtest quickly, plus what to look for in the results.

## What to evaluate (before you pick winners)

When you run a backtest, ignore the hype metrics first and check these:

- **Max drawdown**: can you emotionally and financially survive it?
- **Trade count**: more trades usually means more statistical stability.
- **Sharpe / Sortino**: did you earn returns *efficiently* or through big swings?
- **P-value / significance**: are results likely random noise?
- **Quality grade**: treat this as a *summary*, then inspect the parts.

## 1) 20/50 EMA crossover

Simple trend-following strategy.

- **Good signs**: steady equity curve, acceptable drawdown, solid Sharpe.
- **Bad signs**: long flat periods, frequent whipsaws.

## 2) RSI oversold bounce

Mean-reversion strategy: buy after sharp pullbacks.

- **Good signs**: consistent small gains, good win rate.
- **Bad signs**: rare but huge losses during prolonged downtrends.

## 3) Bollinger Band squeeze breakout

Volatility compression followed by expansion.

## 8) Mean reversion to 50 SMA

Buy “stretched” moves that revert toward the average.

Screen for undervaluation and hold.
