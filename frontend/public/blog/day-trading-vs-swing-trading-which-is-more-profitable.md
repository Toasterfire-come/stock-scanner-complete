# Day Trading vs Swing Trading: Which Is More Profitable?

Profitability depends less on the label and more on **edge + costs + survivability**.

## Day trading

**Pros**

- More opportunities (more trades)
- Faster feedback loop for learning

**Cons**

- Higher friction (spread, fees, slippage)
- Requires consistent execution
- Performance can collapse if you overtrade

## Swing trading

**Pros**

- Lower turnover costs
- Often smoother execution (less noise)

**Cons**

- Fewer trades → slower learning
- Overnight gap risk

## What to compare in your backtests

- **Trade count**: do you have enough signals to trust the result?
- **Expectancy**: average profit per trade after wins/losses
- **Max drawdown**: can you survive it?
- **Sharpe / Sortino**: did you earn returns efficiently?
- **Profit factor**: are wins large enough to cover losses?

## A practical recommendation

- If your strategy depends on small edges, day trading may be **fee-sensitive**.
- If you want a calmer style with fewer decisions, swing trading tends to be easier to sustain.

The right answer is the one you can execute for 12 months without burnout.
