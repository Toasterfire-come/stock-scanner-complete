# How to Beat the S&P 500: A Data-Driven Approach

Beating the S&P 500 isn’t about finding a “secret indicator.” It’s about having:

1. A repeatable edge
2. Risk controls that prevent blowups
3. A process to detect when the edge is gone

## Step 1: Define the benchmark correctly

If you’re comparing to the S&P 500:

- Use the **same time window**
- Compare with **similar exposure** (leverage, cash, volatility)
- Account for **turnover costs** (fees + slippage)

## Step 2: Choose a strategy class that matches your personality

- **Trend-following**: fewer signals, larger swings
- **Mean reversion**: more signals, tail-risk spikes
- **Factor baskets**: slower, steadier, but patience required

## Step 3: Evaluate the risk first

Returns don’t matter if your drawdowns force you to quit.

Check:

- **Max drawdown**
- **Ulcer index**
- **VaR / CVaR**
- **Recovery factor**

## Step 4: Demand statistical evidence

If you have very few trades, or a p-value that suggests randomness, treat the result as a *hypothesis*.

## Step 5: Use constraints that reduce fragility

Examples:

- Minimum trade count threshold
- Max position size / Kelly cap
- Avoiding highly-correlated positions

## Step 6: Compare versions, not just strategies

The best workflow:

1. Backtest baseline version
2. Add one improvement
3. Re-test
4. Keep changes that improve risk-adjusted returns

## Final thought

If you want to beat the S&P 500 consistently, the “edge” is often **risk management + discipline**, not prediction.
