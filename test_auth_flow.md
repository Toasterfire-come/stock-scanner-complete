# Authentication and Subscription Flow Test Guide

## Overview
This guide helps you test the complete authentication and subscription flow for the Stock Scanner application.

## Implementation Summary

### What Was Implemented:

1. **Backend Authentication Endpoints** (FastAPI):

   - `/api/auth/checkout/` - Create checkout session for paid plans
   - `/api/auth/confirm-payment/` - Confirm payment and update membership

2. **Frontend Components**:
   - Updated `SignUp.jsx` to redirect to pricing page after registration
   - Created `PricingPlans.jsx` - Beautiful pricing page with plan selection
   - Created `PaymentSuccess.jsx` - Payment confirmation page
   - Updated API client with authentication functions

3. **Membership Plans**:

## Testing Steps

### 1. Start the Backend Server
```bash
cd /workspace/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```

### 2. Start the Frontend Development Server
```bash
cd /workspace/frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### 3. Test User Registration Flow
1. Navigate to `/auth/sign-up`
2. Fill in the registration form:
   - Username: testuser
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: Test123!
   - First Name: Test
   - Last Name: User
3. Submit the form
4. You should be redirected to the pricing page (`/pricing`)
5. The user is automatically assigned the free plan

### 4. Test Plan Selection
On the pricing page after registration:
1. You'll see 4 plan options (Free, Basic, Pro, Enterprise)
2. Click "Start Free" to continue with the free plan
   - Redirects to dashboard
3. OR click any paid plan button
   - Creates a mock Stripe checkout session
   - In production, this would redirect to Stripe's checkout page

### 5. Test Payment Confirmation
After completing payment (simulated):
1. User is redirected to `/payment-success`
2. Payment is confirmed with backend
3. User's membership is updated to the selected plan
4. User can access premium features

### 6. Test Login Flow
1. Navigate to `/auth/sign-in`
2. Enter credentials:
   - Username: testuser
   - Password: Test123!
3. JWT token is stored in localStorage
4. User is redirected to dashboard with their current plan

## API Endpoints Testing

### Register User
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "testuser",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "Test123!",
    "first_name": "Test",
    "last_name": "User"
  }'
```

### Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "Test123!"
  }'
```

### Get Pricing Plans
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/auth/pricing-plans/
```

### Create Checkout Session
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/checkout/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "plan": "pro"
  }'
```

## Key Features

### Security
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- JWT tokens for authentication
- Token expiration after 7 days
- CORS protection enabled

### User Experience
- Clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Clear pricing comparison table
- Smooth transitions between steps
- Toast notifications for feedback

### Backend Integration
- FastAPI for high performance
- In-memory storage (replace with database in production)
- Mock Stripe integration (ready for real Stripe API)
- Membership tracking with expiration dates

## Production Considerations

1. **Database Integration**:
   - Replace in-memory storage with PostgreSQL/MySQL
   - Use SQLAlchemy or Django ORM for models

2. **Payment Processing**:
   - Integrate real Stripe API keys
   - Implement webhook handlers for payment events
   - Add subscription management (upgrades/downgrades/cancellations)

3. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Use environment variables for secrets
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add email verification
   - Enable 2FA

4. **Additional Features**:
   - Email notifications for plan changes
   - Invoice generation
   - Usage tracking per plan
   - Admin dashboard for user management

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **CORS Errors**:
   - Ensure backend CORS middleware allows frontend origin
   - Check API_ROOT in frontend matches backend URL

2. **Authentication Failures**:
   - Verify JWT secret is consistent
   - Check token is being sent in headers
   - Ensure bcrypt is installed

3. **Payment Flow Issues**:
   - In development, checkout URLs are mocked
   - For production, add real Stripe keys to environment

## Summary

The implementation provides a complete authentication and subscription flow:
- ✅ Users are automatically assigned to free plan on signup
- ✅ Beautiful pricing page shown after registration
- ✅ Users can select and upgrade to paid plans
- ✅ Payment confirmation updates user membership
- ✅ JWT-based authentication for security
- ✅ Clean, modern UI with responsive design

The system is ready for production with minimal changes needed for real payment processing and database integration.
