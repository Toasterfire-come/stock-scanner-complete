- Return visits (long-term investors come back)

**Conversion:**
- Free-to-paid conversion (may initially drop, then improve)

## FINAL NOTES

**Why This Rebrand Matters:**

1. **Sustainable Business:** Long-term investors have higher LTV and lower churn
2. **Less Competition:** Crowded day trading space vs. underserved investor education
3. **Regulatory Safety:** Education is safer than encouraging day trading
4. **Mission-Driven:** Actually help people build wealth, not just trade
5. **Feature Alignment:** Your best features (Value Hunter, Education, Valuation) suit long-term focus

**What NOT to Change:**

- Keep technical analysis features (just de-emphasize)
- Keep charting (but show longer timeframes)
- Keep alerts (but reframe as "monitoring")
- Keep day trading content in library (just don't lead with it)

**The Key Message:**

> "Trade Scan Pro teaches you to invest like the professionals: patient, educated, and focused on value. We give you institutional-grade analysis tools and step-by-step education to build wealth that lasts."
