## 🚨 **To Increase Coverage to 100%**

If you want to collect ALL 3,331 stocks (not just 2,600), you can:

### **Option 1: Add More Free APIs**
```python
# Add these to your collection:
# - Alpha Vantage: 500 calls/day (35 stocks/cycle)
# - Financial Modeling Prep: 250 calls/day (17 stocks/cycle)
# - Twelve Data: 800 calls/day (55 stocks/cycle)

Total with additional APIs: 2,707 stocks (81% coverage)
```

### **Option 2: Reduce Collection Frequency**
```python
# Collect every 15 minutes instead of 10
# This allows Finnhub to handle 900 stocks/cycle
# Total coverage: 2,900 stocks (87% coverage)
```

### **Option 3: Upgrade to Paid Tier**
```python
# Finnhub Pro: $39/month for unlimited requests
# Would provide 100% coverage of all NASDAQ stocks
```
